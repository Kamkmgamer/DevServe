# DevServe Promoter Program

Welcome to the DevServe Promoter Program! We're excited to have you on board. This guide will walk you through how our program works and how you can start earning commissions.

## Getting Started

1.  **Become a Promoter:** Once you are approved as a promoter, a unique referral code will be generated for you. You can find this code in your promoter dashboard.
2.  **Share Your Code:** Share your referral code with your audience, friends, or colleagues.
3.  **Earn Commissions:** You'll earn a commission for every new customer who signs up and makes a purchase using your referral code.

## How It Works

When a new user signs up using your referral code, they are permanently linked to your promoter account. You will earn a commission on all of their purchases.

## Commission Details

*   **Commission Rate:** You will earn a **10% commission** on the total amount of every order made by a user you referred.
*   **Tracking:** You can track your referrals, commissions, and payouts in your promoter dashboard.

## Payouts

*   **Payouts:** Payouts are processed periodically.
*   **Commission Status:** Each commission has a status (`UNPAID`, `PENDING`, `PAID`, `FAILED`). You will be paid for all commissions with the `UNPAID` status.
*   **Payout Status:** Payouts also have a status (`PENDING`, `PAID`, `FAILED`) so you can track the payment process.

## Program Rules

*   Self-referrals are not allowed. You cannot use your own referral code to make purchases.
*   We reserve the right to adjust the commission rate or terminate promoter accounts.

We're thrilled to partner with you. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact our support team.
