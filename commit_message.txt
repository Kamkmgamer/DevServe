feat(client): Refactor HomePage and add new UI components

This commit refactors the HomePage.tsx to improve modularity and readability by extracting various sections into dedicated components under `client/src/components/home`. It also introduces new reusable UI components like `AnimatedCounter`, `Badge`, `Card`, `SectionHeading`, and `SectionSkeleton` in `client/src/components/ui`. Additionally, a new utility for tokens (`client/src/utils/tokens.ts`) and a test file for `PublicLayout` (`client/src/components/layout/PublicLayout.test.tsx`) were added. The `.gitignore` was updated to include log files and the `server/public` directory.
