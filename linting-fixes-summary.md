# Linting Fixes Summary

## Completed Fixes:
- Fixed control character regex errors in SecretDailyTips.tsx
- Fixed unused variables and dependencies in multiple admin pages
- Fixed 'any' type issues in various components and pages
- Fixed import/export issues
- Fixed escape character issues
- Fixed empty block statements
- Fixed unused imports and variables

## Remaining Issues:
1. Control character regex in SecretDailyTips.tsx (line 472)
2. Escape characters in AuthContext.tsx (line 27)
3. Type definitions in react-syntax-highlighter.d.ts
4. 'any' types in tokens.test.tsx and tokens.ts
5. Unused variables in vite.config.ts
6. @ts-nocheck directive in jest.global-setup.ts
7. Unused variables and 'any' types in server files
8. Various other 'any' type issues throughout the codebase

## Recommendations:
1. For the remaining regex issues, consider using a different approach to represent the null character
2. For the 'any' types, define specific interfaces or types where possible
3. For server-side files, consider using stricter TypeScript configurations
4. Consider moving React contexts to separate files to resolve fast refresh warnings
5. Review and remove unused variables and imports
6. Add descriptions to @ts-expect-error directives as required

The majority of the linting errors have been fixed, but there are still several complex issues that require more detailed attention, particularly around type definitions and server-side code.
